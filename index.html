   <!-- About Store Types -->
   <strong>About Store Types</strong>
   <p>
       In the Rossmann sales forecasting, the <strong>"StoreType"</strong> feature categorizes stores into types 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. These types reflect different store characteristics like size, location, and product range:
   </p>
   <ul>
       <li><strong>'a':</strong> Largest or standard stores.</li>
       <li><strong>'b':</strong> Medium-sized stores, possibly with a limited product range.</li>
       <li><strong>'c':</strong> Smaller or specialized stores.</li>
       <li><strong>'d':</strong> Stores with unique characteristics or specific locations.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
       Understanding these types helps improve sales predictions, as each type may have distinct sales patterns.
   </p>

                <h2>4. Summary of EDA</h2>
                <!-- Summary of EDA -->

<p>
<strong>Store Type Performance:</strong> Store Type B (Medium-sized stores) is the top performer in terms of sales volume and customer traffic, making it the most successful and busiest store type.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sales and Customer Correlation:</strong> Sales figures show a strong correlation with the number of customers, indicating that higher customer traffic leads to increased sales.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Effectiveness of Promotions:</strong> Across all store types, promotions effectively boost both sales and customer counts, underlining their role in enhancing store performance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Impact of School Holidays:</strong> Stores open during school holidays achieve higher sales compared to regular days, reflecting increased consumer activity during these periods.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Holiday Analysis:</strong> More stores operate during school holidays than state holidays. Additionally, sales peak during the Christmas week, likely driven by increased demand for beauty products and holiday-related shopping.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Competition Data Insights:</strong> The absence of values in CompetitionOpenSinceYear or CompetitionOpenSinceMonth does not necessarily imply a lack of competition. The presence of non-null CompetitionDistance values indicates that competition exists, even when other related data is missing.

                    <li><strong>Ensure Dependencies are Installed</strong><br>
                    Make sure you have all the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip if needed:
                    <pre><code>pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Save the Code to a Python Script</strong><br>
                    Save the provided code in a Python script file, for example, <code>Random_forest.py</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Run the Script</strong><br>
                    Run the script from the command line or an IDE that supports Python. If you're using the command line, navigate to the directory containing your script and execute:
                    <pre><code>python Random_forest.py</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding the Code</strong><br>
                    Here’s a quick overview of what each part of the script does:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Loading and Preprocessing:</strong> Loads and normalizes the data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Creation:</strong> Creates lag features for the Random Forest model.</li>
                        <li><strong>Training and Evaluation:</strong> Trains the Random Forest model and evaluates its performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plotting Results:</strong> Plots the results of predictions and saves them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forecasting:</strong> Forecasts future sales and saves the results.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
                
    
    <h2>What is Random Forest?</h2>
    <p>Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy. It can handle both classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices) tasks well.</p>
    
    <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
    <p>Decision trees make decisions by asking a series of questions based on features of the data. Each tree can have issues like bias or overfitting, but Random Forest reduces these issues by combining many trees.</p>
    
    <h3>Ensemble Methods</h3>
    <p>Random Forest is an ensemble method that uses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bagging</strong>: Training multiple models on different samples of data and averaging their results to reduce variance.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Randomness</strong>: Training each tree on different subsets of features to improve accuracy and reduce correlation among trees.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p><strong>Node Size, Number of Trees, Number of Features</strong>: Key settings for the model.</p>
    <p><strong>Training</strong>: Each tree is trained on a random sample of the data, and predictions are made by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification).</p>
    <p><strong>Out-of-Bag Samples</strong>: Used for cross-validation to assess model performance.</p>
    
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces risk of overfitting.</li>
        <li>Flexible for various tasks.</li>
        <li>Helps identify important features.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.</li>
        <li>More complex to interpret than a single decision tree.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Finance</strong>: Credit risk evaluation, fraud detection, option pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Gene classification, biomarker discovery, drug response prediction.</li>
        <li><strong>E-commerce</strong>: Recommendations, cross-selling.</li>
    </ul>

                <!-- Model Performance Interpretation -->
                <h2>Early Iteration</h2>
                <p><strong>Training Loss (MSE):</strong> 0.0004147702751754034</p>
                <p><strong>Validation Loss (MSE):</strong> 0.0028658269385234197</p>
                
                <h3>Performance Interpretation: </h3>
                <p>
                    The model's performance is evaluated using two key metrics: Training Loss and Validation Loss. These metrics will determine if there is a case of overfitting or underfitting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Training Loss (MSE) 0.0004147702751754034 :</strong> This value is very low, suggesting that the model fits the training data well and has learned the underlying patterns from it effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>
                        Validation Loss (MSE) 0.0028658269385234197: </strong> This value is significantly higher than the Training Loss, indicating that the model's performance on new, unseen data is not as strong as it is on the training data.
                </p>
                <h3>Interpretations </h3>
                <p>
                    The discrepancy between the low Training Loss and higher Validation Loss suggests that the model might be overfitting. While it performs excellently on the training data, it struggles to generalize to new data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, which negatively impacts its performance on validation data. This suggests the need for strategies to improve generalization, such as regularization or model simplification
                </p>
                <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
                <p>
                    To address this, you might consider:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Applying regularization techniques (e.g., L1/L2 regularization) to reduce overfitting.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Final Performance Results</h2>
                <p><strong>Training Loss (MSE):</strong> 0.0033199530559485</p>
                <p><strong>Validation Loss (MSE):</strong> 0.006474465520687854</p>
                <p><strong>Cross-validated MSE:</strong>  0.006220120581014061</p>

                    <h2>R-squared Formula</h2>
                    <p>This formula represents R-squared as 1 &minus; 
                        <sup>&#x2211;</sup>(y<sub>i</sub> &minus; ŷ<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup> /
                        <sup>&#x2211;</sup>(y<sub>i</sub> &minus; ȳ)<sup>2</sup>, where:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>y<sub>i</sub></i> is the actual value,</li>
                        <li><i>ŷ<sub>i</sub></i> is the predicted value,</li>
                        <li><i>ȳ</i> is the mean of the actual values.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h2>R-squared Values</h2>
                    <p>The R-squared values based on the given MSE and variance of the sales data are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Training R-squared:</strong> 0.9999999998</li>
                        <li><strong>Validation R-squared:</strong> 0.9999999996</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Validation R-squared:</strong> 0.9999999996</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h2>Considerations</h2>
                    <p><span class="highlight">Overfitting:</span> If the R-squared value is extremely high, especially on the training data, there is a risk that the model might be overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model captures not only the underlying patterns but also the noise in the training data, which can lead to poor performance on new, unseen data.</p>
                
                    <p><span class="highlight">Validation and Cross-Validation:</span> Since the R-squared values for both validation and cross-validation are also close to 1.0, this suggests that the model is performing very well on unseen data, reducing the concern of overfitting.</p>
                
                    <p><span class="highlight">Domain Context:</span> In some contexts, a high R-squared value might be expected, while in others, it might raise questions. For example, in time series forecasting, where patterns might be predictable, a high R-squared might be reasonable. However, in more complex, noisy data (like stock prices), an R-squared this high might seem suspicious.</p>
                
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Given the high R-squared values across training, validation, and cross-validation, the model appears to be very good.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Daily Variability:</strong> Forecasted sales change a lot from day to day. Some days have much higher sales, while others have lower sales. This shows that daily sales are affected by different factors each day.</li>
    <li><strong>High Sales Days:</strong> On some days, forecasted sales are very high, reaching up to 10,000 units. These peaks likely result from special events, promotions, or seasonal factors that boost sales significantly.</li>
    <li><strong>No Clear Trend:</strong> There is no clear pattern of sales increasing or decreasing over time. The forecasted sales appear random, with no consistent trend. This suggests that sales fluctuations are due to varying and unpredictable factors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
  <p>Sales forecasts show large day-to-day variations, with some days having much higher sales than others. There’s no obvious trend, indicating that the changes are due to unpredictable factors or events.</p>
